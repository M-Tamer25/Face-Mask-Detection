## 📌 Overview
This project is a real-time Computer Vision system designed to enforce safety protocols by detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks. It combines **Deep Learning** for classification with a modern **Tkinter GUI** for user interaction.

Developed as a Computer Vision project at the **Faculty of AI, Menoufia University**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Real-Time Detection:** Uses OpenCV and a pre-trained Caffe model (SSD) for fast face detection.
* **High Accuracy:** Powered by **MobileNetV2**, fine-tuned for mask classification.
* **Interactive GUI:** Built with `CustomTkinter` to provide visual feedback:
    * 🟢 **Green:** "Eligible to Pass" (Mask Detected)
    * 🔴 **Red:** "WARNING" (No Mask Detected)
* **Automated Workflow:** Includes scripts for dataset downloading, training, and deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x 🐍
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras (MobileNetV2 Architecture)
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV (cv2)
* **GUI:** CustomTkinter
* **Data Processing:** NumPy, Pillow

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/M-Tamer25/Face-Mask-Detection.git](https://github.com/M-Tamer25/Face-Mask-Detection.git)
cd Face-Mask-Detection
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Train the Model (Optional): If you want to retrain the model from scratch:

Bash

python train_mask_detector.py
🧠 Model Architecture
The system uses a two-stage pipeline:

Face Detector: A ResNet-10 SSD (Single Shot Detector) model to locate faces in the frame.

Mask Classifier: A MobileNetV2 base (frozen) with a custom head for binary classification (Mask / No Mask).

Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-4)

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

📊 Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the validation set.
